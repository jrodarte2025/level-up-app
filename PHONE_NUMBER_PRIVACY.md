# Phone Number Privacy & Compliance Guide

## Privacy Considerations for Phone Number Collection

### ‚úÖ Current Implementation
- Phone numbers are **optional** - users are never required to provide them
- Phone numbers are stored in normalized format (10 digits) for consistency
- Phone numbers are only visible in the member directory to logged-in users
- No automated SMS or calls are sent without explicit user consent

### üìã Compliance Checklist

#### GDPR (if applicable to EU users)
- [ ] Update Privacy Policy to mention phone number collection
- [ ] Explain purpose of collecting phone numbers (directory/contact)
- [ ] Provide option to delete phone number (already implemented)
- [ ] Include phone number in data export functionality

#### US Privacy Laws
- [ ] Update Terms of Service if needed
- [ ] Consider CCPA compliance if California users
- [ ] Implement age verification (no phone collection under 13)

### üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Only collect phone numbers when necessary
   - Allow users to remove phone numbers anytime

2. **Access Control**
   - Phone numbers only visible to authenticated users
   - Consider role-based visibility (students see students, etc.)

3. **Data Protection**
   - Phone numbers normalized and validated before storage
   - No phone numbers in URLs or logs
   - Use Firebase Security Rules to protect data

### üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Privacy Settings**
   ```javascript
   phonePrivacy: {
     visibility: "all", // "all", "matches", "coaches", "none"
     allowSMS: false,   // Opt-in for SMS notifications
   }
   ```

2. **Phone Verification**
   - Send verification code via SMS
   - Mark verified numbers with badge
   - Only allow SMS to verified numbers

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log when phone numbers are added/changed
   - Track who views phone numbers (if sensitive)

### üì± SMS/Calling Features (Future)

If you plan to add SMS or calling features:

1. **Obtain Explicit Consent**
   - Separate opt-in for SMS notifications
   - Clear unsubscribe mechanism
   - Record consent timestamp

2. **Message Frequency**
   - Disclose frequency in opt-in
   - Respect quiet hours (no night messages)
   - Rate limit messages per user

3. **Compliance Requirements**
   - TCPA compliance for US (requires express written consent)
   - Include STOP instructions in every message
   - Maintain do-not-contact list

### üìù Recommended Privacy Policy Addition

```

communication between members through our directory feature. Phone numbers
